# A-Pathfinding-Visualization

This is my second python project

I was inspired by Tech With Tim with his video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A

## Commands
- r : random
- c : clear screen / reset
- space : find path
- left mouse button : place objects (start, end, walls)
- right mouse button : remove placed objects (start, end, walls)
